#  Eniac-Magist
## Project Reflection – Eniac & Magist Market Expansion Analysis
### Summary
This project evaluates whether Eniac should partner with Magist to expand into the Brazilian eCommerce market. Brazil offers strong growth potential, but Eniac lacks local logistics and market knowledge. Using a snapshot of Magist’s database and external market research, we assessed Magist’s suitability for high-end tech products and its ability to meet Eniac’s delivery and customer experience standards. The final deliverable is a data-driven recommendation presented to Eniac’s leadership.

### Languages and Tools Used
- **SQL** for data extraction and analysis
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards
- **Google Slides** for collaborative presentation development

### Key Learnings
The project strengthened the ability to translate data into strategic insights and communicate them clearly to non-technical stakeholders, with a strong focus on actionable business decisions.

### Challenges Overcame
Key challenges included evaluating logistics performance and delivery speed while keeping the analysis focused on decision-making rather than descriptive metrics. 
We also assessed Magist’s ability to sell Eniac’s tech products, analyzed local buying patterns, compared average order values, and identified where high-value customers are concentrated.

### Additional Reflections
Market expansion decisions require more than revenue potential. Delivery speed, operational reliability, and brand positioning are equally critical.
